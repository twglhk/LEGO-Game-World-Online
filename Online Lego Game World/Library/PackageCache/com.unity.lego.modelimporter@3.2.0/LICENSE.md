# License & Terms

Thank you for your interest in the LEGO® Microgame using the Unity Editor to design games incorporating LEGO® elements, and where you may subsequently upload to  https://connect.unity.com/discover and/or https://play.unity.com (the “Site”) as part of the Unity Learn Hub user flow.

Your use of the LEGO® Microgame is subject to the terms set forth on Unity’s legal page (unity3d.com/legal) including the Unity Terms of Service and the Unity Software Additional Terms.

Additionally, there are special terms that apply to designers and the game designs incorporating LEGO® elements that you create and/or upload to the Site, (collectively “Designer Terms”).

By downloading and using the LEGO® Microgame Unity project and assets and/or the Site or uploading any LEGO® game designs to the Site you agree to these Designer Terms.

# Designer Terms:

a. These Designer Terms apply if you: i) utilize LEGO® elements provided within the LEGO® Microgame; ii) upload images or assets of LEGO® elements from external sources into the Unity Editor or Site; iii) create an 2D or 3D asset of a brick model from LEGO® elements provided within the LEGO® Microgame or the site; iv) create or upload a 2D or 3d Asset of a brick model from external sources; or v) upload a 2D or 3d Asset of a brick model of a design created via i. – iv. (“LEGO Designs”) for use in a game incorporating LEGO® elements.

b. By designing in the Unity editor or elsewhere and/or uploading your LEGO Designs, you agree that you and all aspects of your LEGO Designs comply with these Terms, and that any such LEGO Designs shall not be used for commercial purposes, in any manner whatsoever.

c. You are solely responsible for your LEGO Designs and related content and the consequences of uploading and publishing your LEGO Designs and related content on the Site. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish and display all aspects of your LEGO Designs and all related content you upload.

d. You agree that the content you upload to the Site, including but not limited to your LEGO Designs, will not contain, use or infringe any third party copyrighted material, or any material that is subject to other third party proprietary rights (including trademarks, image or personality rights, or other intellectual property rights), unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material. You expressly affirm, represent and warrant the content you upload to the Site will not result in any third party infringement claims against the LEGO Group of any intellectual property right or other right of any third party, and you hereby indemnify and hold the LEGO Group harmless from any and all such claims.

e. Your LEGO Designs must be constructible: Any person must be able to actually build your Designs using unforced, proper clutch connections. Your LEGO Designs cannot require a change or otherwise modify the shape of any existing LEGO® element, including but not limited to stretching or cropping elements, and your LEGO Designs cannot include LEGO® elements that do not currently exist (for example a 2 x 25 stud brick).

f. Your LEGO Designs must be your own: You must have the exclusive right to upload your LEGO Designs to the Site. This means: i. Your LEGO Design uploads are your own work and no one else’s. The only exception to this rule is if you are the parent or legal guardian uploading a LEGO Design on behalf of your child under the age of majority. The same policies and guidelines apply for kids’ designs. Any model or LEGO Design uploaded by you in violation of the foregoing may be taken down without notice.

ii. You agree not to upload images, assets or game designs that belong to someone else as a part of your LEGO Designs, even if that person gives you permission.

iii. Your LEGO Design does not contain and is not based on any third party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to third party proprietary rights (including trademarks and other intellectual property rights).

g. Your LEGO Designs must abide by legal constraints: We are not obligated to evaluate any LEGO Design submission for license conflicts. However, listings may be removed at any time if legal issues arise or a third party makes an allegation regarding your LEGO Design. To avoid this, you should do your own research for potential conflicts before uploading a LEGO Design into your game.

This list of prohibitions provides examples and is not complete or exclusive. Unity retains the right to suspend, terminate, or otherwise sanction your use of the Site and your account if you violate these rules of conduct, as well as to take or fail to take any other action required under any applicable laws.
